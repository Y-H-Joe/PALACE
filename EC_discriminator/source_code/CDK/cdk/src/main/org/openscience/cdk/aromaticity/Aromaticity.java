/**
 * A configurable model to perceive aromatic systems. Aromaticity is useful as
 * both a chemical property indicating stronger stabilisation and as a way to
 * treat different resonance forms as equivalent. Each has its own implications
 * the first in physicochemical attributes and the second in similarity,
 * depiction and storage. 
 * <p/>
 * To address the resonance forms, several simplified (sometimes conflicting)
 * models have arisen. Generally the models <b>loosely</b> follow
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel's_rule">Hückel's rule</a>
 * for determining aromaticity. A common omission being that planarity is not 
 * tested and chemical compounds which are non-planar can be perceived
 * as aromatic. An example of one such compound is, cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene.
 * <p/> 
 * Although there is not a single universally accepted model there are models
 * which may better suited for a specific use (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NextMoveSoftware/cheminformatics-toolkits-a-personal-perspective">Cheminformatics Toolkits: A Personal Perspective, Roger Sayle</a>).
 * The different models are often ill-defined or unpublished but it is important
 * to acknowledge that there are differences (see. <a href="http://blueobelisk.shapado.com/questions/aromaticity-perception-differences">Aromaticity Perception Differences, Blue Obelisk</a>).
 * <p/>
 * Although models may get more complicated (e.g. considering tautomers) 
 * normally the reasons for differences are: 
 * <ul> 
 *     <li>the atoms allowed and how many electrons each contributes</li>
 *     <li>the rings/cycles are tested</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * This implementation allows configuration of these via an {@link 
 * ElectronDonation} model and {@link CycleFinder}. To obtain an instance
 * of the electron donation model use one of the factory methods, 
 * {@link ElectronDonation#cdk()}, {@link ElectronDonation#cdkAllowingExocyclic()},
 * {@link ElectronDonation#daylight()} or {@link ElectronDonation#piBonds()}.

 * // mimics the old CDKHuckelAromaticityDetector which uses the CDK atom types

 * CycleFinder      cycles      = Cycles.cdkAromaticSet();
 * Aromaticity      aromaticity = new Aromaticity(model, cycles);

     * Create an aromaticity model using the specified electron donation {@code

     * {@code cycles} defines the {@link CycleFinder} which is used to find
     * cycles in a molecule. The total electron donation from each atom in each
     * cycle is counted and checked. If the electron contribution is equal to
     * {@code 4n + 2} for a {@code n >= 0} then the cycle is considered
     * aromatic. <p/> Changing the electron contribution model or which cycles
     * are tested affects which atoms/bonds are found to be aromatic. There are
     * several {@link ElectronDonation} models and {@link

     * fast but may produce an exponential number of cycles. It is therefore not
     * feasible for complex fused systems and an exception is thrown.
     * In such cases the aromaticity can either be skipped or a simpler
     * polynomial cycle set {@link org.openscience.cdk.graph.Cycles#relevant()}
