Converted from Christoph's EndNote database:
1. export in BibTex format from EndNote
2. sanitized that output (e.g. added refid) with 
   JReferences 0.7.2's (in CVS) endnote-sanitize
3. converted to BibTeXML with JReferences 0.7.1's
   bibtex-xml
4. apply Kate's word wrapping, otherwise CVS will 
   choke on the rather long lines
5. removed all refs that are not yet used (CVS still
   did not cope with the document)

BibTeX and DocBook XML docs are autogenerated with
JReferences' jref-convert. (See Makefile)
