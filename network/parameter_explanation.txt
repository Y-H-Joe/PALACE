PALACE_preprocess.py:
features:supports additional features on source and target words in the form of discrete labels (https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT/data/word_features/)
dynamic_dict (bool): Whether or not to include source map and
            alignment fields.
n_src_feats (int): the number of source features (not counting tokens)
    to create a :class:`torchtext.legacy.data.Field` for. (If
    ``src_data_type=="text"``, these fields are stored together
    as a ``TextMultiField``).
n_tgt_feats (int): See above.
dynamic_dict (bool): Whether or not to include source map and
    alignment fields.
with_align (bool): Whether or not to include word align.
src_truncate: Cut off src sequences beyond this (passed to
    ``src_data_type``'s data reader - see there for more details).
tgt_truncate: Cut off tgt sequences beyond this (passed to
    :class:`TextDataReader` - see there for more details).

PALACE_train.py:
tgt_vocab_size:
By default, features vocabulary size is unlimited. Depending on the type of features you are using, you may want to limit their vocabulary during the preprocessing with the -src_vocab_size and -tgt_vocab_size options in the format
